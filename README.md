# React Router Demo

A minimal React application set up with Vite and React Router to demonstrate basic routing in a modern React environment.

## Project Structure

```
React_routerDemo/
├── public/
├── src/
│ ├── App.jsx # Root component — contains your routes
│ └── main.jsx # App entry point — includes Vite + Router setup
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── eslint.config.js
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or Yarn

---

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/imamulkadir/React_routerDemo.git
cd React_routerDemo

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

## Features

- **React + Vite** — Fast development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **React Router integration** — Client-side routing with `react-router-dom`
- **ESLint** — Basic project linting setup for clean code

## Usage

- Modify or add routes in `src/App.jsx` using `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, etc.
- Create new components inside `src/` and map them in your routing.
- Relaunch the dev server if necessary — Vite supports instant updates.

## Notes

- This is a _starter/demo_ project, ideal for experimenting with routing patterns like nested routes, dynamic params, protected routes, etc.
- There’s currently no README content in the repo — you’ve filled that gap now!
